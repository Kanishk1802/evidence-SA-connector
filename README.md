# Evidence Datasource Connector Template

## Usage

### Configuring [package.json](./datasource/package.json)
1. Update the package name
2. Update `evidence.datasources`
    1. This contains an array of arbitrary data source names that users will use to select this source in their connection.yaml files
    2. If your connector supports multiple sources, or you have several aliases (e.g. psql, postgres, postgresql), you can provide a nested array, this will show only the first item in the UI
        - In this example, `postgres`, `psql`, `postgresql`, `redshift`, and `timescaledb` will all select this connector  
        However, only `postgres`, `redshift`, and `timescaledb` will be presented as options in the UI.
            ```json
            {
                "evidence": {
                    "datasources": [
                        [ "postgres", "psql", "postgresql" ],  // Shows only `postgres` in the UI
                        "redshift",
                        "timescaledb"
                    ]
                }
            }
            ```
3. Optionally, specify an icon for your datasource.
    1. Icons can come from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), or [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/).
    2. Evidence uses [Steeze UI](https://github.com/steeze-ui/icons#icon-packs) for our icons, so the casing must match  
        the Steeze UI export
   ```json
   {
       "evidence": {
           "icon": "YourIconName"
       }
   }
   ```

### Specify your connector's options

[`index.js`](./datasource/src/index.js) defines the type `ConnectorOptions`, and exports an `options` constant.  

`ConnectorOptions` should be typed to the expected configuration for your datasource (e.g. hostname, port, etc)  

`options` defines how your connector will be configured in the UI, we recommend reading the [docs](https://https://docs.evidence.dev/plugins/creating-a-plugin/datasources#options-specification), and/or taking a look at the [Evidence Postgres Connector](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence/blob/main/packages/datasources/postgres/index.cjs#L242). Technically, implementing this is optional, but it provides a much better user experience when your datasource is installed.

### Choosing an interface

Evidence accepts 2 different interfaces when using datasources, one is much easier to write, but is much less flexible.

> Note that [`lib.js`](./datasource/src/lib.js) has a stubbed `databaseTypeToEvidenceType`, which is helpful for building `ColumnTypes` more easily.

#### Simple Interface

For the simple interface, implement the `getRunner` function; which is a factory pattern for building a configured QueryRunner.
Each query can either return an array of results, or an [async generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*) if implementing cursor logic (this enables much larger datasets)

#### Advanced Interface

For the advanced interface, implement the `processSource` function; which is an [async generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*) returning tables directly.

`processSource` receives a proxy of the source's filetree, so it must look for files itself, but returns results in the same available formats as `getRunner`. `processSource` should be used in instances where ***output tables do not map one to one with input files*** (e.g. if a list of tables is provided in `connection.yaml` that should all be `SELECT *`'d)


### [Recommended] Write Unit Tests

This template comes with [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) pre-installed. If you've used [jest](https://jestjs.io/), vitest implements a very similar API.

Tests have been stubbed in [`index.spec.js`](./datasource/src/index.spec.js), and can be run with `npm run test`

Typescript has also been included with a basic configuration, and your types can be checked with `npm run check`

### Testing your datasource

1. Install your connector in `test-project` using `npm i ../datasource`
2. Add your connector's package name to [`evidence.plugins.yaml`](./test-project/evidence.plugins.yaml)
3. Create a source that uses your connector
   1. You can either create it manually in [`sources`](./test-project/sources/), or in the [settings ui](http://localhost:3000/settings).
   2. If you populated your `options` object, testing it in the settings UI is recommended.
4. Use `npm run sources` in the test project to execute your datasource, and modify [`index.md`](./test-project/pages/index.md) to use your new source.
   1. It can also be helpful to referenecs the [`schema explorer`](http://localhost:3000/explore/schema) to make sure that the types returned  
     by your connector match what you are expecting.
